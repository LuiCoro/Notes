# How To Read Notes/ Work with Notes

The notes are seperated into seprate folders based on what Lamdba has caught us and plenty of outside note form Udemy!
Each folder is named to its language

# Freedom!
Use the notes any way you feel free to. THESE NOTES ARE NOT 100% SPELLING ACCURATE(i cant spell very well), ALSO THE NOTES ARE NOT PERFECT BUT THERE HERE TO HELP US STUDY. Great thing about the notes is that they are constantly being updated with some new topics manily focusing around JavaScript,HTML , And CSS.

# important information!
To better navagate the seas of Notes its personally recommended to use the Comment Anchor to move thru the notes and find what your looking for more easily! (the note Nav will get better once time comes and im not too busy).

# Updates
Updates will happpen conastantly during the next couple of months up until either I get tired of typing(or I win the lottery which ever comes first.). Check to see the commits on the Git Hub to regularly see what is being Added, Updated, Deleted, Fixed, Changed, etc. 

# Extensions(OPTIONAL EXCEPT FOR #1 ON LIST)
1) Comment Anchor (VERY HELPFUL TOOL TO MOVE AROUND IN NOTES)
2) Quokka.js (JavaScipt Sandbox in Vs Code instead of using Chrome)
3) Fast Arrow (optional)
4) More to Come
